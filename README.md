# Course-Selection-SearchV2
Course selection search Java app to improve schedule building for classes. This was the result of a semester-long
Group final project for my Database Management class in sophomore year.

Using  Java, Selenium WebDriver, Java Swing, joda, and more to automate scraping of class and professor data, create a local database using, generate a user interface, and run queries to retrieve Information based on user input as indicated using the user interface.

This app generates a suggested schedule based on user school profile accessed via login upon launch, which from there the user can select other classes beyond the suggested list to tailor to their needs. Schedules are generated to make sure time conflicts do not happen.


# Note
Project is mostly done, but not fully complete. There are some bugs to iron out as time conflicts do occasionally still happen with generated schedules.

Project as of April 2016.
